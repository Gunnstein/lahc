Late Acceptance Hill Climbing
=============================

Implementation of Late Acceptance Hill Climbing (LAHC) algorithm by
Burke and Bykov [Burke2017]_ in python.


Installation
------------

Download the repository to your computer and install, e.g. by **pip**

::
   pip install .


Usage
-----

The package provides a base class for subclassing to a specific
problem. The ``move`` and ``energy`` methods must be implemented by the
user before the algorithm is applied.

The user controls the algorithm by adjusting a single algorithmic
parameter, the ``history length``, and the termination criteria for
the algorithm. See subsection on each of the topics below.

The search is started by calling the ``run`` method.

The example is a good place to start using of the package.

Note
    The implementation relies heavily on copying the state. The
    default copy strategy (``copy_strategy='deepcopy'``) relies on the
    STL ``copy.deepcopy`` method which works for most data structures,
    but is typically quite slow. **Large** performance gains can be
    easily obtained by adapting a different copying strategy, see the
    documentation of the ``copy_state`` method.


The history length
------------------

The behaviour of the LAHC algorithm is governed by a single parameter,
the history length. To alter the history length of the algorithm,
adjust the ``history_length`` parameter of the class.

If the history length is set to one, the LAHC algorithm is equivalent
to a greedy Hill Climbing algorithm. Increasing the history length
generally improves the solution quality, but also increases the time to
convergence.

Selection of the history length should therefore be based on
requirements for the quality of the solution and time available for
the analysis.

A useful characteristic of the LAHC heuristic is that the runtime to
convergence is roughly proportional to the history length. The runtime
at any history length can therefore be estimated after applying the
algorithm at a few different history lengths.

As a general recommendation, start at a low history length and
gradually increase it to determine the runtime and variation in the
estimated results. Select a shorter history length that allows
multiple runs in the time allocated for simulations rather than a
longer history length with a single run.


Termination criteria
--------------------

The algorithm terminates when the ``terminate_search`` method evaluates
to `True` or when a interupt signal (``Ctrl-C``) is sent to the process.

The default behaviour of the ``terminate_search`` method is to
terminate the algorithm when a minimum number of attempts has been
made and the algorithm has not been able to improve the solution for a
certain number of steps. The minimum number of steps and necessary
number of idle iterations can be adjusted with the ``steps_minimum``
and ``steps_idle_fraction`` parameters, respectively.

The default value of the ``steps_idle_fraction`` (0.02) is generally a
good choice for a variety of problems, but the default
``steps_minimum`` value (100000) may have to be adjusted depending on
the problem. As a general recommendation, the user should reduce the
``steps_minimum`` parameter if the algorithm consistently terminates at
``steps_minimum`` after running for a long period without improving
the solution.

The package is heavily influenced by the simanneal_ project, which implements
the Simulated Annealing metaheuristic, a widely used and sucessful
optimization method.
